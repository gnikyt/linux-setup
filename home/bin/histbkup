# This script creates monthly backups of the bash history file. Make sure you have
# HISTSIZE set to large number (more than number of commands you can type in every
# month). It keeps last 200 commands when it "rotates" history file every month.
# Typical usage in a bash profile:
#
# HISTSIZE=90000
# source ~/bin/history-backup
#
# And to search whole history use:
# grep xyz -h --color ~/.bash_history.*
#

KEEP=200
BASH_HIST=~/.bash_history
BACKUP="$BASH_HIST".$(date +%Y_%m)

# History file is newer then backup
if [ -f "$BACKUP" ]; then
  # There is already a backup
  cp -f "$BASH_HIST" "$BACKUP"
else
  # Create new backup, leave last few commands and reinitialize
  mv -f "$BASH_HIST" "$BACKUP"
  tail -n "$KEEP" "$BACKUP" > "$BASH_HIST"
  history -r
